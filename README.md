# DoggoDash

Welcome to DoggoDash! DoggoDash is an interactive web app created using Dash and Python which provides visualizations for users to explore the breeds of dog that best match their selected preferences. Whether you are a potential new dog owner or are curious about your current dog breed's ranking among others, DoggoDash can help you!

## Installation

DoggoDash is hosted online by Heroku and can be accessed [here](http://dsci532-2022-group18-py.herokuapp.com/). There is no local installation required.

## Usage

Users can choose the dog traits of interest from the dropdown menu (i.e. Affectionate With Family, Coat Type, Adaptability Level, Trainability Level). Thereafter, the user can decide the importance of each selected trait according to their preference using the slider provided (1 slider for importance of positive traits, 1 for importance of negative traits). As a result of the preferences, our algorithm will return a list of top five dog breeds that fit your preferences the most (in descending order) and display it on the landing page of the app. There will also be a plot showing the yearly ranking trends of the 5 selected dog breeds as well as a table with the details of each individual trait selected. From there, users can explore the recommended breeds and determine which one is the best for them!
